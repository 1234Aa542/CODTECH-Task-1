1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of basic data structures in C++: Linked List, Binary Tree, and Graph. It includes operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal for each structure, showcasing how they can be used for solving problems in computer science.

2. Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Implement and understand basic data structures like Linked List, Binary Tree, and Graph.
Learn how to perform common operations such as inserting, deleting, searching, and traversing these structures.
Understand the functionality of each structure and how they can be used in real-world applications.
3. Key Activities
Linked List: Implemented insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations.
Binary Tree: Implemented insertion, search, and in-order traversal operations.
Graph: Implemented edge addition, breadth-first search (BFS), and search for a target node.
Demonstrating how these operations work with simple examples in the main() function.
4. Technology Used
Programming Language: C++
Data Structures:
Linked List (using nodes)
Binary Tree (using tree nodes)
Graph (using adjacency list and BFS)
Key Concepts: Object-oriented programming, dynamic memory allocation, iterative traversal, and search algorithms.
